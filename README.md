CommitGen
=============
This project is a part of CS 5704 (Software Engineering) course. This project uses GumTree to identify changes between the head of a Git repository and the current status of a repository and describes the changes in natural languages (e.g. English). The natural language is further improved by using a neural machine translation technique.
