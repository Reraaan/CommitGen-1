CommitGen
=============
This project is a part of CS 5704 (Software Engineering) course. This project uses GumTree to identify changes between the head of a Git repository and the current status of a repository and describes the changes in natural languages (e.g. English). The natural language is further improved by using a neural machine translation technique.

GumTree
=======
This project utilizes the fine-grained source code change tool called GumTree. We modify the implementation to add additional functionalities to support the automatic commit generation. The modified gumtree implementation is availabe at https://github.com/salmanyam/gumtree-modified.

Please Note
===========
We are working on the project. Stay tuned for the stable verison!
